<h1>Space Can Be Both Amazing & Terrifying</h1>

<p>"Modern science says: 'The sun is the past, the earth is the present, the moon is the future.' From an incandescent mass we have originated, and into a frozen mass we shall turn. Merciless is the law of nature, and rapidly and irresistibly we are drawn to our doom."
  -Nikola Tesla
